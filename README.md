Note: The BlueStacks menu item will be disabled

####BlueStacks is not installed:


Note: BlueStacks does not have to exist in the typical /Applications or ~/Applications install locations. As long as OS-X Finder's location service can find it, it can be used.



##Disclaimer: 

I have no connection to BlueStacks other than as an end-user and this is not a direct endorsement for their product (other than as a satified user).
